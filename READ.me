This project is about reproducing a bootstrap using sass and jquery.
Each feature is in a separate scss file to make the comprehension easier.
To change the colours or the breakpoints, please refer to the "_variables.scss" file.
The navbar is fixed on top when scrolling, you can change that by delete the three lines under the comment in the "navbar" class inside the "_navbar.scss" file.
